            <p class="highlight-description"><b>"The hand of God"</b> was a handling goal scored by Argentine footballer Diego Maradona during the Argentina v England quarter finals match of the <b>1986 FIFA World Cup</b>. 
                The goal was illegal under association football rules because Maradona used his hand to score, but because the referees did not have a clear view of the play it stood to give Argentina a 1–0 lead.</p>

            <p class="highlight-description">"At the <b>World Cup</b> where I was the coach (of Argentina), I took charge of the best version of Messi. I'll tell everyone that. He was incredible. 
                After training had finished, we stayed behind to practice shooting. That's when he started taking more shots at goal. Not because I showed him how to! I only said:
                'You need to hit it into the middle'," he added whilst laughing. "Now he scores all the time!", said Maradona in a press conference.</p>
